# Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration between technical and
domain experts to model complex domains effectively. The core concept is to create a shared understanding of the domain
through ubiquitous language and to structure the software around the domain model. DDD helps in aligning the software
design with business needs and making the system more maintainable and adaptable to changes.

## Mapping DDD Concepts to Tracepaper Concepts

| **DDD Concept**      | **Description**                             | **Tracepaper Concept**       | **Description**                             |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Entities**         | Objects with a distinct identity            | **Aggregate Document**       | Clustered entities managed as a single unit |
| **Value Objects**    | Objects defined by their attributes         | **Not explicitly mapped**    | N/A                                         |
| **Aggregates**       | Cluster of entities and value objects       | **Aggregates, Behavior Flows**| Clustered entities with business rules      |
| **Repositories**     | Mechanisms for accessing aggregates         | **Abstracted by technical framework** | Handled through event sourcing             |
| **Services**         | Operations that don't belong to entities    | **Automations**              | Logic and operations                        |
| **Factories**        | Methods for creating aggregates             | **Abstracted by technical framework** | Handled through event sourcing             |
| **Domain Events**    | Events indicating something has happened    | **Events**                   | Significant occurrences that trigger changes|
| **Commands**         | Instructions to perform an action           | **Commands**                 | Requests for state changes or operations    |
| **Bounded Contexts** | Logical boundaries within the domain        | **Subdomains**               | Defines scope and boundaries of the model   |

This table shows how the core concepts of Domain-Driven Design are integrated into the Tracepaper modeling tool, 
facilitating a clear and structured approach to system design.
