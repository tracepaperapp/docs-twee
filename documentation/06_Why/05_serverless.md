# Why Serverless

## What is Serverless?

Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation
and provisioning of servers. AWS offers a range of serverless services such as AWS Lambda, AWS AppSync, and Amazon
EventBridge, which allow developers to build and run applications without having to manage infrastructure.

## Benefits of Serverless on AWS

1. **Scalability**:
    - **Automatic Scaling**: AWS serverless services automatically scale to handle the demands of your application. AWS
      Lambda, for instance, scales in response to incoming traffic, ensuring consistent performance during peak loads
      without manual intervention.

2. **Cost Efficiency**:
    - **Pay-as-You-Go**: With serverless, you only pay for the compute time you consume. AWS charges you based on the
      number of requests and the duration your code runs, which can significantly reduce costs compared to traditional
      server-based architectures.

3. **Reduced Operational Overhead**:
    - **No Server Management**: AWS handles the infrastructure management, including server maintenance, patching, and
      scaling. This allows your development team to focus on writing code and delivering features rather than managing
      servers.

4. **Enhanced Agility**:
    - **Faster Deployment**: Serverless architecture enables rapid development and deployment cycles. AWS services such
      as Lambda and AppSync integrate seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines, allowing for continuous integration and delivery.

5. **Event-Driven Design**:
    - **Integration with AWS Services**: AWS serverless services are designed to work well together. For example, you
      can use Amazon EventBridge to trigger AWS Lambda functions, enabling an event-driven architecture that is highly
      responsive to changes and real-time data.

6. **High Availability and Reliability**:
    - **Built-in Fault Tolerance**: AWS serverless services offer built-in fault tolerance and availability. AWS Lambda
      functions are replicated across multiple availability zones, ensuring that your application remains resilient and
      highly available.

## Why Serverless Fits Our Architecture

1. **Alignment with CQRS and Event Sourcing**:
    - Our choice of CQRS and event sourcing patterns fits perfectly with serverless architecture. AWS Lambda functions
      handle commands (writes) and queries (reads) efficiently, while services like EventBridge facilitate event-driven
      communication.

2. **Seamless API Management**:
    - Using AWS AppSync for our GraphQL API management aligns with our need for flexible and scalable API solutions.
      AppSync simplifies the creation and management of GraphQL APIs, allowing us to focus on delivering business value.

3. **Optimized for Domain Experts**:
    - Serverless architecture abstracts away infrastructure complexities, allowing domain experts to focus on system
      design and business logic. This aligns with our goal of enabling domain experts to contribute directly to the
      system without needing deep technical expertise in infrastructure management.
    - While serverless icreases configuration complexity, this is largly abstracted away by the Tracepaper modeling concepts.

## Conclusion

Choosing a serverless architecture on AWS provides us with scalability, cost efficiency, reduced operational overhead,
and enhanced agility. These benefits align perfectly with our design patterns (CQRS and event sourcing) and our goal of
empowering domain experts to focus on delivering business value. AWS's comprehensive suite of serverless services
ensures that our applications are robust, scalable, and maintainable, supporting our long-term objectives.
