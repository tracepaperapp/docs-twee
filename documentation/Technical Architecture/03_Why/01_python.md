# Why Python

Our goal is to make system design accessible to domain experts, and Python is central to achieving this. Here’s why we
chose Python, especially in the context of our AWS-based infrastructure:

## Benefits of Python

1. **Readability and Simplicity**:
    - Python’s clean and easy-to-understand syntax is perfect for domain experts with limited programming experience.
    - Emphasis on readability reduces the learning curve and helps in quickly grasping complex business-logic.

2. **Rich Ecosystem and Libraries**:
    - Python has a vast ecosystem of [libraries](https://pypi.org).
    - These libraries expedite development and provide powerful tools for solving domain-specific problems.

3. **Integration Capabilities**:
    - Python integrates seamlessly with AWS with the aid of the [boto 3 library](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html).

4. **Community Support**:
    - A large and active community provides extensive documentation, tutorials, and support.
    - Community-driven development keeps Python up-to-date with the latest technological advancements and best
      practices.

5. **AWS Lambda**:
   - Python’s lightweight and efficient nature is ideal for serverless functions, enabling scalable and
  cost-effective execution.

## Python and Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

Python’s simplicity and readability align well with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles:

- **Expressive Code**: Python’s syntax mirrors domain-specific language, facilitating understanding and contribution
  from domain experts.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Python’s dynamic nature and extensive library support enable quick prototyping, allowing domain
  experts to see and refine system designs swiftly.

## Conclusion

Choosing Python helps us bridge the gap between complex system design and domain expertise. Its readability,
versatility, rich ecosystem, integration capabilities, and strong community support make it the ideal language for
empowering domain experts to contribute effectively to system design, especially within our AWS-based infrastructure.
